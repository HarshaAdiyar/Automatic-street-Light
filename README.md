# Automatic-street-Light
Automatic-street-Light with Arduino

Automatic street Light is a project as part of academics of cource Microprocessor and Computer Architecture.
Component Required: 
  * Arduino Uno board
  * 2 IR sensors
  * Relay Module
  * Bulb
  
Project Goal: To reduce the power consumption by making street lights on and off automatically whenever Human,moving objects,animals and vehicale's.

Implementation :  In street light we need keep IR sensors which will detect the movement of object towards light and gives signal to microcontroller which will turn on light and when object passed out there is another IR sensor which will turn off the street light.Relay module is used to turn on and off switch which will take low signal input from arduino and turn on 230 volts.

Apllications:
* Efficintly reduces the power consuption,
* we can implement in High ways ,
* we can impliment in city with varing brightness ,
* No need of manual operation.
